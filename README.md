# MilitaryServicesBackend
  This is the backend of a web application that calculates the services every day for each soldier of the Greek or any army for each unit.
It is strongly recommended anyone to read the documents found here https://github.com/antonisstathis/MilitaryServicesDocs/tree/main/BackEndDocs 
before runs or test the app. These documents provide the official back-end application documentation and explain everything the tester needs to 
know, including its purpose, policies, and the mechanisms behind how it works. Skimming through the documentation will not be sufficient. It is 
important to carefully read all the lines in the .md files to fully understand the functionality, policies, and mechanisms of the application.

  The user that has the role of commander can define the services for his unit. The soldiers belong to one of two categories. The one category
is armed soldiers that can carry a gun and can be assigned any service without restrictions and the other category is soldiers which are not allowed 
to carry a gun due to health problems and they can be assigned services like watching the cameras. The services have two categories too like the soldiers.
Armed and unarmed ones. The front end of the app is in this repository https://github.com/antonisstathis/MilitaryServicesFrontend. 
The backend is in java programming language and the framework is spring boot. The user that has the role of a soldier responsible for the calculation of the 
services of the day can calculate the services for each day with just a click of a button.
